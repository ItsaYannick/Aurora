Aurora Update Assistant

Aurora is a Python script that checks for Arch Linux system updates using pacman and gives sassy, personality-driven responses depending on how many packages are out of date.
It can prompt the user to update, or even force an update if the package count is critical.

Place Aurora.py and responses.py in the same directory.

Run the script:
  python Aurora.py
Aurora will:

Print the number of updatable packages.

Respond sassily based on thresholds.

Ask (or force) updates depending on severity.
